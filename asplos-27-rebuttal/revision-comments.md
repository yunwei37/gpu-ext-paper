## Author revision comment

@A1 ✎Author [Yusheng Zheng]·Aug 3

We thank the reviewers and the committee. We will implement these changes:

Q1, state-of-the-art baselines (Reviewers E, F). We will add at least three runnable state-of-the-art research baselines, such as MoE-Infinity, XSched, and an extension of the existing LMCache comparison to its local-disk backend. When an artifact cannot run on our hardware but its policy fits our hooks, we will implement the policy instead, as we already do for GPREEMPT's priority timeslicing (Fig. 12) and will do for Expert Buffering's hot-expert residency. Where neither route is open we will name the system and say why.

Q2, safety and design depth (Reviewers B, F). We will add transition-validation pseudocode, the SIMT verifier algorithm, examples of rejected policies, a failure-mode taxonomy, and an explicit account of the trusted computing base to the design and implementation sections.

Policy versus mechanism (Reviewer F). We will add a policy expressibility table separating what is feasible in user space, what requires driver modification, and what gpubpf supports, and we will expand Fig. 13. For each policy class we will state which of the two the result depends on.

Measurements, artifacts, and discussion. We will add RTX 5090 numbers to Table 1 (Reviewer A) and release the agent prompts and benchmark harnesses (Reviewer E). The text will also address thrashing under stale state, CXL tiers, per-tenant policies, trampoline scaling, and portability (Reviewers A, D), and will distinguish our software co-location setting from the static partitioning the SemiAnalysis critique targets(Reviewer E).

## Shepherd follow-up

@A2Shepherd·Aug 14

The revision plan overall looks good. Please ensure other clarifications presented in the original author response are integrated into the paper where appropriate.

Policy versus mechanism

In addition to expressibility/feasibility of the mechanism, it would be great to improve the overall exposition, which has not come up quite as clear in the paper. Specifically, please make the below points clear:

Whether your mechanism can implement many of the existing policy (which you say you will do)

When implementing an existing policy using your mechanism, how does the performance compare with the original ad-hoc/unsafe/monolithic implementation.

Just to be clear: there's definitely value in having a safe/flexible mechanism even if all the case studies one presents only match the SOTA, rather than surpassing it.

But to help the readers put the results in perspective, it would be good to explicitly discuss whether the headline improvement numbers throughout (especially in abstract and introduction) come from the policy or the mechanism, and if this more general mechanism has any performance drawbacks when implementing an existing policy. This is important to avoid any perceived misleading statement.

Call out any new policy enabled by/implemented in your mechanism (especially any interesting policy discovered by an agentic workflow). This sort of insights would be very useful to the broader community when we think about future systems design.
Another suggestion you can consider: in your original response, there are answers to common themes of questions from reviewers (e.g., safety, or comparison/reimplementation of SOTA) that scatter across multiple subsections. It might help readers navigate the discussion to group relevant points under common headings, and label them accordingly.

Typographic nits:

In section 5.3, paragraph headings have two periods at the end.
The curly braces in the bib don't seem to be escaped properly.
Please let me know if you any question about the reviews.
